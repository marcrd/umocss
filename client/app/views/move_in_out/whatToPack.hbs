Packing and Moving Checklist
5
If this is your first time moving into a place off campus there are going to be things that come with your new place (like a microwave),
things you and your housemates will plan to buy when you get here, and there’ll be things you’ll bring with you. Since many of you
have lived on campus, you’ve probably got your bedroom pretty well squared away. As for the rest of the rooms, the best way to
plan for your move is to use a good checklist. This one is about as comprehensive as we could think to make it. What’s already in
your rental, what you plan to purchase when you get here, what you’re bringing from home, and who’s going to bring it.
